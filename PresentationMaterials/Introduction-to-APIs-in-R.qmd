## Learning Objectives

By the end of this workshop, you should be able to: 

- Explain what an API is.
- Be able to use API documentation to explore available API endpoints.
- Fetch data from an API using the `httr2` library.
- Understand pagination and be able to apply strategies to work with API limits. 

## Ways of accessing data

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}

#### Manual 

- Download files from the web (CSV, Excel, Text, Parquet, etc.)
- Copy manually from websites (tables, charts, text)
- Extract data from documents (Word  or PDFs)

:::


::: {.column width="60%"}

#### Automatic

- Databases
- APIs
- Web Scraping (Extract information from web pages programmatically)
- Sensors

## Why use an API?

- You need the most up-to-date information.
- You don't need everything - you can ask for exactly what you want.
- It's repeatable - you can write code once, and reuse everytime you need new data.
  
## What is an API?

. . . 

API stands for:

**A**pplication **P**rogramming **I**nterface

## Types of APIs

. . .

**SOAP** 

- Legacy API, used primarily for banking and healthcare
- Data is delivered as `XML`
- Much more complex to implement and use

**REST**: 

- The standard for accessing data on the web
- Flexible: can deliver data in `XML` or `JSON`

## Structure of an API Request

## Structure of an API Response

Each API response is composed of two parts:

. . . 

**header**: information about the data 

. . . 

**body**: the data

. . .

Think of an API response like an envelope you received in the mail. 

## 

On the outside of the envelope there is information like:

- The address it was addressed to
- The address where it came from
- The postage date, which indicates when it was posted

. . . 

This metadata, or "data about data", tells you about the letter contained within --- who sent it, to whom, and when?. 

. . .

In an API response this is the API **header**. It contains information about the data being delivered. 

. . .

The **body** of the API contains the actual contents of the letter (the data).
